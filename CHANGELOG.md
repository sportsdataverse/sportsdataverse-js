# Changelog

All notable changes to `sportsdataverse` (Node.js) are documented here. The
docs-site copy lives at [`docs/src/pages/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/src/pages/CHANGELOG.md)
and renders at <https://js.sportsdataverse.org/CHANGELOG>.

## v3.0.0

A major release that turns `sportsdataverse` into a **cross-league ESPN client**
**plus a native (non-ESPN) live-API client** with a tidy parser layer.

### ESPN cross-league surface

- **116 endpoint wrappers** generated for **29 leagues** (31 namespaces) from a
  single YAML source of truth — every league exposes the same
  `espn_<league>_<short>` methods (e.g. `sdv.nba.espn_nba_scoreboard()`,
  `sdv.soccer.espn_soccer_scoreboard({ league: 'eng.1' })`). Soccer, cricket, and
  the UFL join the existing NBA/NFL/NHL/MLB/WNBA/MBB/WBB/CFB set.

### Native API integration (255 flat wrappers across 7 families)

Beyond ESPN, the package now wraps the major leagues' own live APIs, merged onto
the matching league namespace:

- **MLB Stats API** (`statsapi.mlb.com`) — `sdv.mlb.mlbApi*` (e.g. `mlbApiSchedule`).
- **Baseball Savant / Statcast** (`baseballsavant.mlb.com`) — `sdv.mlb.mlbStatcast*`,
  including date-chunked Statcast search; heterogeneous CSV/JSON/HTML responses are
  handled by a content-type-aware getter.
- **NHL** — api-web game feed + EDGE player tracking (`api-web.nhle.com`),
  Stats REST (`api.nhle.com/stats/rest`), and Records (`records.nhl.com`):
  `sdv.nhl.nhlApiWeb*` / `nhlEdge*` / `nhlStatsRest*` / `nhlRecords*`.
- **NFL.com "Shield" API** (`api.nfl.com`) — `sdv.nfl.nflApi*`, with automatic
  anonymous `WEB_DESKTOP` bearer-token minting (cached + auto-renewed; no
  credentials required).

### Provider families (5 cross-sport, standalone namespaces)

Beyond ESPN + the league-native APIs, v3.0.0 adds **five independent provider
families**, each generated from a canonical OpenAPI spec (the `sdv-swagger`
collection) via a new reusable **OpenAPI 3.x → endpoint-YAML transform**
(`tools/codegen/from-openapi.mjs`, with path / query / `$ref` param resolution +
auth detection). Each cross-sport family gets its own standalone `sdv.<ns>.*`
namespace and its own generated reference page; pass `{ parsed: true }` for tidy
rows. The transform makes adding the next provider largely mechanical.

- **The Odds API** (`sdv.odds.*`, 10 endpoints) — betting odds / scores / events
  across sports. `apiKey` is a plain query param you supply. Ported from
  [`oddsapiR`](https://oddsapiR.sportsdataverse.org); odds / event / history
  parsers unroll events → bookmakers → markets → outcomes to one row per outcome.
- **247Sports** (`sdv.recruiting.*`, 25 endpoints) — recruiting rankings /
  commits / profiles (caller-supplied JWT via `headers`). Supersedes the legacy
  `getPlayerRankings`-style service methods (kept for back-compat).
- **CBS Sports** (`sdv.cbs.*`, 82 endpoints) — the public NAPI (scores /
  standings / teams / odds across sports), keyless.
- **Fox Sports** (`sdv.fox.*`, 38 endpoints) — the Bifrost API (`{sport}` path
  param across 11 sports); a public `apikey` + `api-version` query pair, defaulted.
- **Yahoo Sports** (`sdv.yahoo.*`, 107 endpoints) — the editorial scoreboard /
  boxscore feed + the shangrila stats-graph API; keyless (needs browser-y
  `Origin` / `Referer` headers).

In total: **517 flat-API wrappers across 13 families** (the 7 native + 5 provider
+ Statcast).

### tidy.js parser layer

- Every native wrapper returns the raw response by default; pass `{ parsed: true }`
  to run the payload through a registered parser that flattens it to a tidy array
  of row objects via a shared in-house `normalize` helper (a `json_normalize`
  equivalent). Strictly additive — omitting `parsed` is the unchanged raw-response
  behavior, matching `sportsdataverse-py`'s `return_parsed=True`.
- The [`@tidyjs/tidy`](https://github.com/pbeshai/tidy) toolkit is re-exported
  (`import { tidy } from 'sportsdataverse'`) so the parsed tidy arrays compose
  directly with grammar-of-data-manipulation verbs (`groupBy`, `summarize`, …).
- **ESPN parsed dispatch.** The cross-league ESPN wrappers now accept the same
  `{ parsed: true }` flag — a faithful port of `sportsdataverse-py`'s
  `_common_espn_parsers` (22 parsers: scoreboard / standings / rosters / leaders /
  athlete deep-dives / the 21-sub-frame `summary` dispatcher, plus two generics
  for the Core v2 list + single-resource long tail). All **116** ESPN endpoints
  route through these parsers; `summary` additionally honours a `section` arg
  (`{ parsed: true, section: 'boxscore_team' }`). Omitting `parsed` is the
  unchanged raw-`Dict` behavior.

### Dual-case naming

- Every generated wrapper (ESPN and native) is exposed under BOTH its snake_case
  name (`mlb_api_teams`, py/R parity) and its camelCase canonical name
  (`mlbApiTeams`, idiomatic JS) — the same function under either name.

### Docs + playground

- Generated reference pages now include a **Native API — `<family>`** section per
  league (host, path, params, parser, auth gate).
- A shared **ESPN parsed returns** reference page documents the `col_name | type |
  description` columns each of the 22 ESPN parsers produces (the 116 endpoints
  share them, so they're documented once by parser rather than repeated per
  endpoint), with every league page linking to it.
- The live [playground](https://js.sportsdataverse.org/playground) groups native
  endpoints under their league by family and runs them through a flat-aware
  serverless proxy — host-allowlisted (derived from the generated metadata), with
  server-side token minting for NFL.com and content-type passthrough for Statcast
  CSV/HTML so credentials never reach the browser and non-JSON bodies display raw.
  It now also has a **Raw/Parsed toggle** (tidy rows render as a sortable table —
  with a section selector for the 21-sub-frame `summary` dispatcher),
  **deep-linkable URLs** (every call is shareable), and an **Examples menu** of
  curated presets across ESPN, the native APIs, and all 5 providers. The provider
  families each appear under their standalone namespace.
- **Getting-started guides** (`/docs/guides/`) — per-area recipe pages (quickstart,
  NBA/WNBA/college-basketball/NFL/MLB/NHL/CFB/soccer, providers) with runnable
  raw-vs-parsed snippets, "Open in playground" deep-links, and embedded **RunKit**
  live notebooks.

### Tooling / housekeeping

- **Migrated to TypeScript.** Authored in TypeScript; ships `.d.ts` declarations
  alongside the ESM build.
- **ESM-only, Node ≥ 20.18.1.** `cheerio` 1.2 (via `undici` 7) sets the floor.
- **Codegen + drift gate.** `npm run codegen` regenerates the wrapper tables
  (ESPN + flat) and docs from `tools/codegen/endpoints/*.yaml`;
  `npm run codegen:check` fails CI if the committed output is stale.
- **Legacy methods preserved.** Every pre-3.0 method (`sdv.nba.getPlayByPlay(id)`,
  etc.) still works — the generated wrappers are merged *alongside* them.

## v2.0.0

- Major version bump to 2.0.0.
- Convert to ESM (fixes the `tabletojson` import error).
- Update dependency versions.
- Remove broken functions due to API 404s so all tests pass (mbb `getRankings`,
  wbb `getRankings`, ncaa `getTeamStats` / `getScoringSummary`).

## v1.2.5

- NFL `getWeeklySchedule` function added by @unmonk.

## v1.2.4

- MLB functionality added by @unmonk.

## v1.2.0–1.2.2

- Updated standings functions to provide league-wide, conference, and division
  splits for each applicable sport from ESPN.

## v1.1.0

Breaking changes:

- Submodules simplified/removed — all functions are now `{sport-league}.getXXX`
  (e.g. `cfb.getTeamList()` instead of `cfbTeams.getTeamList()`).
- Support for statistics from stats.ncaa.com added.
- Documentation website created.
